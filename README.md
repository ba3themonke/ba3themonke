### Hi there :3

I'm ba3, I like creating mods for the popular VR game "Gorilla Tag"! I've started the game a few years ago *(almost at release)* but only recently starting making mods for it!

Although I'm new to modding Unity games I do have some past experience with other programming languages!!

You can reach out to me on Discord at: "yewo_6", or join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Gxsf7bCP4D)

Big thanks to all of my friends *but specifically @ch7cken*!!

@ch7cken has helped me make lots of mods as well as helped me get through tough times when nobody else was there for me. I recomend you check out their account as they make some super great mods!

âœ¨Thx for reading!!âœ¨
